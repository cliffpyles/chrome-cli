# Chrome CLI

Chrome CLI is a command-line interface tool to manage Google Chrome bookmarks across different profiles. The tools is **intended for my personal use**. Currently the tool facilitates exporting bookmarks in various formats such as JSON, CSV, Markdown, and more. More actions may be implemented at a later date.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download and install Node.js from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

To set up the Chrome CLI tool on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cliffpyles/chrome-cli.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd chrome-cli
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Link the package globally to use the `chrome` command anywhere on your system:
   ```bash
   npm link
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can use the `chrome` command followed by specific subcommands and options to interact with your Chrome bookmarks.

### Commands

#### List Bookmarks

- **Description**: Lists all Chrome bookmarks from all profiles in the specified format.
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  chrome bookmarks list [options]
  ```
- **Options**:
  - `-f, --format <type>`: Specify the output format. Supported formats are `json`, `csv`, `text`, `raw`, and `markdown`. The default format is `json`.

### Examples

- List bookmarks in JSON format:
  ```bash
  chrome bookmarks list --format json
  ```
- List bookmarks in CSV format:
  ```bash
  chrome bookmarks list --format csv
  ```
- Display raw bookmark data:
  ```bash
  chrome bookmarks list --format raw
  ```

### Bookmark Data Format

The Chrome CLI tool exports bookmarks in several formats such as JSON, CSV, Markdown, text, and raw. Each format presents the bookmark data with specific semantics to accommodate different usage contexts. This section details the semantics of the bookmark data.

#### Fields in Bookmark Object

Each bookmark object contains these key fields:

- **name**: Title of the bookmark.
- **url**: URL of the bookmark.
- **date_added**: Date and time the bookmark was added, in ISO 8601 format.
- **guid**: A unique identifier for the bookmark.
- **type**: Type of the item (`url` for bookmarks, `folder` for directories).
- **folder_name**: Name of the immediate folder containing the bookmark.
- **folder_path**: Full path from the root to the bookmark's folder.
- **profile_name**: Name of the associated Chrome profile.
- **profile_email**: Email associated with the profile.

#### Example of Nested Bookmark Structure

Consider a nested bookmark structure like this:

- **Resources**
  - **Articles**
    - **Technology**: Bookmark to a tech article.
  - **Docs**
    - **Meeting Notes**: Bookmark to online notes.

Hereâ€™s how a sample of the bookmarks might look in JSON format:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Technology",
    "url": "https://example.com/tech-article",
    "date_added": "2023-05-20T15:30:00Z",
    "guid": "1234",
    "folder_name": "Technology",
    "folder_path": "Resources/Articles/Technology",
    "profile_name": "User",
    "profile_email": "user@example.com"
  },
  {
    "name": "Meeting Notes",
    "url": "https://example.com/meeting-notes",
    "date_added": "2023-05-20T12:00:00Z",
    "guid": "5678",
    "folder_name": "Docs",
    "folder_path": "Resources/Docs",
    "profile_name": "User",
    "profile_email": "user@example.com"
  }
]
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the CLI, first ensure that you are running the latest version of Node.js and that all dependencies are correctly installed. Check the console output for any error messages that could provide more insight into what might be going wrong.
